# SerialBox Random FlavorPack

## Simple and Efficient

The SerialBox Random FlavorPack adds the ability to serve up non-repeating randomized 
numbers from SerialBox in a simple and efficient fashion.  All of the 
API functionality of the SerialBox framework can still be leveraged and the 
only difference in the execution of the `Allocation API` is that the return 
value numbers list will most likely contain more numbers than usual. 

## Easy to Install

Since it is implemented as a FlavorPack, all you need to do is install it
in your INSTALLED_APPS dictionary after SerialBox, make and run your migrations and you are 
ready to go!  For more see the installation instructions in this documentation.
